      <p>
        At PyCon UK 2022, Peter Russell
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gIX_-ABHs8">gave a talk</a> on
        the <a href="https://gigatron.io/">Gigatron</a> "a minimalistic retro
        computer" that you make yourself. By the end of Peter's talk, I'd found
        an eBay listing for a Gigatron printed circuit board (PCB). A few
        minutes after the talk, I'd bought the PCB.
      </p>

      <p>
        Considering how little I know about computer architecture or
        electronics, not to mention the very little soldering experience, it
        wasn't the wisest decision I've ever made. But after getting home from
        PyCon, I figured I might as well follow through and started working out
        how to buy the other parts.

          Unicorn HAT, it's a miracle that it works.

        The inventors of the Gigatron, Marcel van Kervinck and Walter Belgers,
        used to sell Gigatron kits. These days it's a DIY affair. (A few
        companies do sell Gigatron kits but not in the UK. The kit prices are
        high enough that they seem likely to fall foul of import duty, VAT and
        the associated delivery fees.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Luckily the Gigatron website has a detailed assembly guide and a bill of
        materials. Even more usefully, the bill of materials has links to the
        components on various electronics websites, including Mouser, DigiKey
        and Farnell. Mouser seemed to have the best reviews and promised to
        handle things like UK VAT, avoiding nasty delivery fee surprises, so I
        went with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Putting together a basket of 37 components veered wildly between
        straightforward and confusing. Some items had lead times of a year or
        more and I wasn't patient enough to wait that long. The ERPOM (erasable
        programmable read-only memory), the microcontroller for the PS/2
        keyboard adapter, zener diodes, and several of the simpler chips seemed
        to be in very short supply.
      </p>

      <p>
        Swapping out parts meant a lot of Googling, trying to work out the
        difference between a CD74HCT244E, a SN74HCT244NE4 and a SN74HCT244N. The
        most important part seemed to generally be in the middle, e.g. 74HCT244,
        with other letters being manufacturer codes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nearly all the chips in the Gigatron are 74HCT, which I learned is a
        specific "logic family". The most important thing for me was that chips
        with that code are compatible with each other, for example they expect
        the same power supply. There are closely related chips, like the 74HC or
        74LS, that seem to be compatible if you fiddle a bit with the circuit. I
        was absolutely not going to do that and stuck to the 74HCT chips.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the items with long lead times, like the EPROM and the ATtiny85
        microcontroller, I went to eBay. eBay had the components, or seemingly
        compatible ones, but the listings seemed expensive. (Surely a 1MB EPROM
        didn't cost Â£6 before the electronics shortage happened??) But in for a
        penny, in for a pound. (Too many pounds...) The information in the
        Gigatron bill of materials was fantastic again and I managed to find
        components. Hopefully I got something workable.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are still a few things on the shopping list, not least the
        famicom-style controller and a box to hold the Gigatron. But with small
        and large parcels falling through my post box most days, ordering those
        can wait a while.

          Buying 1 or 2 of each part meant an incredible amount of packaging.
