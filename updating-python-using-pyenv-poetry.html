        This isn't rocket science but is something I do infrequently enough to

      <p>
        In code blocks, lines beginning <code>$</code> are commands and lines
        without show output. There are a few simple bash commands (e.g.
        <code>cd</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        It's assumed that you already use Pyenv and Poetry and want to change a
        project's Python version.

        Optional: Store virtual environment in project
      </h2>
      <p>
        By default, Poetry creates virtual environments outside of projects, in
        Poetry's own cache directory. (Usually something like
        /home/ellen/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I've started to prefer venvs in their project directories. There's
        something tidy about having everything in the project directory. If I've
        messed something up and want to delete the venv, I don't have to
        remember which directory it was created in. VSCode also notices a venv
        created in a project and asks if I want to start using it, which means a
        little less configuration.
      </p>
      <p>One time change:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
$ poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
      </code></pre>

      <h2 id="install-the-preferred-version-of-python">
        Install the preferred version of Python
      </h2>
      <p>
        If Pyenv was installed a while ago, there are probably new Python patch
        releases and maybe even a new minor version. The code uses Python 3.10
        as an example.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
$ pyenv update  # Update Pyenv and the list of available Python versions
$ pyenv install --list | grep "3.10"  # Check which versions of 3.10 are available
$ pyenv install 3.10.2  # This will take a while

$ cd a_project_directory
$ pyenv local 3.10.2  # Creates file .python-version, telling Pyenv which version to use when in the directory
    </code></pre>

      <h2 id="replace-the-virtual-environment">Replace virtual environment</h2>
      <p>
        The existing venv was created using the old version of Python and should
        be replaced. It's also worth telling Poetry which version of Python to
        use because Poetry doesn't always grab the right one. (The behaviour can
        depend on things like which Poetry installer you used and whether you
        installed Poetry or Pyenv first. More info in GitHub issues
        <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/5077">5077</a>
        and
        <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/5190">5190</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The code example assumes the existing virtual environment was created in
        the project directory.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
$ rm -rf .venv
$ poetry env use $(pyenv which python)
$ poetry install
      </code></pre>

      <h2 id="a-note-on-shims-and-debugging">A note on shims and debugging</h2>
      <p>
        Pyenv uses shims to select and run the expected version of Python. In
        other words, Pyenv intercepts calls related to Python and decides which
        Python executable to use. That's why you can type <code>python</code> in
        one directory and expect a Python 3.8.12 shell, while expecting that
        <code>python</code> in another directory will start a Python 3.10.2
        shell. That's incredibly useful but adds a little complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        When getting an unexpected version of Python, it can be useful to check
        both the system's builtin <code>which</code> command and Pyenv's
        <code>which</code> command.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
$ which python
/home/ellen/.pyenv/shims/python
# defers to Pyenv

$ pyenv which python
/home/ellen/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/bin/python
# the Python exectuable that will be used
</code></pre>

      <p>
        It can also be useful to check the virtual environment's configuration
        file pyvenv.cfg
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
$ cat .venv/pyvenv.cfg
base-executable = /home/ellen/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/bin/python
# plus other info about the configuration of the venv
</code></pre>

      <p>
        If several things are trying to set the version (e.g. environment
        variable and .python-version file), refer to Pyenv's documentation about
        <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#choosing-the-python-version"
          >how it chooses which version to use</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2 id="all-the-code">All the code</h2>
      <p>Assumes you have a virtual environment in the project directory.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
$ pyenv update
$ pyenv install --list | grep "3.10"
$ pyenv install 3.10.2

$ cd a_project_directory
$ pyenv local 3.10.2

$ rm -rf .venv
$ poetry env use $(pyenv which python)
$ poetry install
      </code></pre>
