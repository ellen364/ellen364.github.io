      <h1>Reducing boilerplate with Python dataclasses</h1>
      <p>
        I used to think of dataclasses as something like a fancy namedtuple. To
        borrow an example from the
        <a
          href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple"
          >Python docs</a
        >, I might do this
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float
    y: float
    </code></pre>
      <p>rather than this</p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple("Point", ["x", "y"])
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        But it turns out dataclasses are a lot more useful that. Rather than
        "fancy namedtuples", dataclasses are more like "fancy classes". They can
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>help classes behave in a Pythonic way</li>
        <li>reduce boilerplate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All at the same time! Here's a simplified Book written as a standard
        class.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, year=2022):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.year = year

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Book(title={self.title}, author={self.author}, year={self.year})"

    def cite(self):
        return f"{self.author}, {self.title} ({self.year})"
    </code></pre>

      <p>
        That works. But there's a chunk of boilerplate to give the Book instance
        its data and get a nice string representation. Only the
        <code>cite</code> method has logic that's particularly specific to the
        Book class. (The attribute names reflect Book characteristics, like
        title, but nothing uniquely book-like happens in the
        <code>__init__</code> or <code>__repr___</code>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Worse, this class can't be used in some basic ways. Python doesn't know
        how to compare Book instances, so doesn't recognise when one book is the
        same as another and can't sort a list of books.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">
book = Book("Histories", "Herodotus", -430)
identical_book = Book("Histories", "Herodotus", -430)
book == identical_book
# False

book2 = Book("The History of England", "Thomas Macauly", 1848)
sorted([book, book2])
# TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Book' and 'Book'
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        The Book class has a <code>__repr__</code> method, allowing the use of
        both <code>str(book)</code> and <code>repr(book)</code>. But it doesn't
        have other dunder (double underscore) methods that support operators
        like <code>==</code> and <code><</code>. In other words, a little more
        boilerplate is needed.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">
from functools import total_ordering

@total_ordering
class Book:
    # Methods hidden for brevity
    # __init__, __repr__, cite
  
    def __eq__(self, other):
        # If both objects are books, check if all values are equal
        # If other object is not a Book, let Python raise a TypeError
        if other.__class__ is self.__class__:
            return (self.title, self.author, self.year) == (other.title, other.author, other.year)
        return NotImplemented
    
    def __gt__(self, other):
        # If both objects are books, check if values of the book on the left are 
        # greater than values on the right
        if other.__class__ is self.__class__:
            return (self.title, self.author, self.year) > (other.title, other.author, other.year)
        return NotImplemented
    
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Book instances can now be compared and sorted, thanks to the
        <code>__eq__</code> (equality) and
        <code>__gt__</code>
        (greater than) dunder methods and
        <a
          href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.total_ordering"
          >total_ordering</a
        >
        decorator. The decorator isn't essential; it reduces repetition by
        letting the programmer define <code>__eq__</code> and one other
        comparison dunder method (<code>__gt__</code>, in this case). Without
        <code>total_ordering</code>, it would be necessary to add the other
        comparison dunder methods: <code>__gte__</code>, <code>__lt__</code> and
        <code>__lte__</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A dataclass provides this behaviour with even less effort. The class and
        dataclass below, shown side by side, work identically. They have the
        same init behaviour, same string representation, even the same
        comparison and sort behaviour. But the dataclass takes care of the
        boilerplate.

      <p>
        Dataclasses allow some simple customisation. In the example above,
        <code>order=True</code> is used to add comparison behaviour to the
        class. By default, dataclasses only provide <code>__init__</code>,
        <code>__repr__</code> and <code>__eq__</code>. (In other words, that's
        what you get when using the dataclass decorator without any arguments.)
        Behaviours can be turned off by passing the relevant argument to the
        decorator, e.g. <code>repr=False</code> or, in some cases, defining the
        method youself, e.g. adding your own <code>__repr__</code> to the class.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Default settings (automatic __init__, __repr__, __eq__)
@dataclass
class Book:
    title: str
    author: str
    year: int = 2022


# Don't create __repr__ method
@dataclass(repr=False)
class Book:
    title: str
    author: str
    year: int = 2022


# Use custom __repr__ method
@dataclass
class Book:
    title: str
    author: str
    year: int = 2022

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Book: {self.title}"
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        After a certain point, it's worth implementing the dunder methods
        manually rather than tweaking and overriding dataclass behaviour. For
        example, the preferred ordering of Books might not be title, then
        author, then year. Perhaps ordering should happen author first. Or
        perhaps the author shouldn't be included in the ordering at all. In
        cases like those, custom dunder methods are still needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dataclasses do a lot, though, and they're a great way to add Pythonic
        behaviour to classes.

        For more info about dataclasses, try Eric V. Smith's proposal for adding
        them to Python,
        <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/"
          >PEP 557 -- Data Classes</a
        >. It's excellent and I wish I'd read it sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dunder methods (a.k.a. magic methods) can add a lot more Pythonic
        behaviour to custom classes, e.g. letting them behave like Python lists
        with indexing, slicing and looping. I like Rafe Kettler's
        <a href="https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/"
          >Guide to Python's Magic Methods</a
        >. A few things are specific to Python 2, but they're noted in the short
        appendix and aren't likely to be relevant when you're starting out. In
        my experience, it's easiest to start with "Comparison magic methods" and
        then move onto "Making custom sequences", which are things that behave
        like lists.
