      <p>
        Here's a "how to" for serving a static site from Caddy, with a side of
        debugging advice and a few sysadmin tips.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I started using Caddy I found the documentation a bit hit and miss.
        Some of it's great, but after reading the docs I didn't always
        understand how simple things fit together. When setting up my first
        Caddy server, I also realised that I'd become used to automated
        deployments and was surprised by simple things like "Where should the
        files go on the server??" The how to covers a few of those topics as
        well.
      </p>

      <h2 id="install-caddy-on-server">Install Caddy on server</h2>

      <p>
        The official website has good instructions for
        <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/install">installing Caddy</a> on
        your server. For Linux, the most common server OS, the instructions
        mostly involve running commands to add a new package repository.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since there's some copy-pasting, it's worth following that old sysadmin
        trick: type the comment symbol <code>#</code> at the start of the line,
        then paste the command. Because the command is a comment, it won't run
        unexpectedly even if a newline gets copied into the terminal. When
        you're sure the command is right, remove the <code>#</code> comment
        symbol and run.
      </p>

      <h2 id="check-caddy-is-running">Check Caddy is running</h2>

      <p>
        By default, Caddy runs in the background via systemd. Caddy seems to
        automatically start itself after installation, but it's worth
        double-checking using
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-text">
$ systemctl status caddy

# Start of output
# ‚óè caddy.service - Caddy
#     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/caddy.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
#     Active: active (running) since Fri 2022-06-03 07:32:56 UTC; 1 weeks 5 days ago
#       Docs: https://caddyserver.com/docs/
</code></pre>

      <p>
        Most of the time, you'll want Caddy to be running and enabled. (Where
        "running" means that Caddy is on and "enabled" means that Caddy will
        automatically start after a server reboot.) Luckily, these seem to be
        the default settings.
      </p>

      <h2 id="put-the-static-files-on-the-server">
        Put the static files on the server
      </h2>

      <p>
        For the purposes of the article, I'm going to assume the static site has
        a really simple directory structure:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-text">
static-site/
    index.html
    a-post.html
    styles.css
</code></pre>

      <p>At this stage, there are a couple of decisions to make.</p>

      <p>
        Decision one is how you'll put files onto the server. There are lots of
        ways of doing that, so it's really down to your preferences. For simple
        static sites, I like to make the directory a git repo, clone it on the
        server and <code>git pull</code> to get updates. Depending on your
        situation, all sorts of things from <code>rsync</code> to a CI/CD
        pipeline could be decent options.
      </p>

      <p>
        Decision two is where the static site directory will live. I've found it
        most convenient to put the static site directory inside the directory
        <code>/var/www</code>, e.g. <code>/var/www/my-static-site</code>. It
        seems to be a common location, so there's a decent chance it will be
        familiar to other developers. Log files often go into the nearby
        <code>/var/log</code> (discussed in a moment), which keeps everything
        close together in the directory structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you've decided where the files are going and how you'll do it, put
        the static files onto the server.
      </p>

      <p>
        After copying the files, make sure the <code>caddy</code> user can read
        the static site directory. If the caddy user can't access the directory,
        you'll get get permission errors when Caddy tries to access and serve
        the files.
      </p>

      <p>
        For those learning Linux,
        <code>ls -l</code> is a useful way of checking the owner and group
        permissions of the directory. If the output is scary and unfamiliar,
        it's worth reading this short overview of
        <a
          href="https://linuxfoundation.org/blog/classic-sysadmin-understanding-linux-file-permissions/"
          >file permissions</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2 id="a-quick-detour-http">A quick detour: start with HTTP</h2>

      <p>
        For simple static sites, I tend to start by serving the files via HTTP
        and without a domain.
      </p>

      <p>
        A great feature of Caddy is the
        <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https"
          >"automatic HTTPS"</a
        >, which means that Caddy gets the TLS certificate and keeps it renewed.
        But there's a gotcha - if you make lots of mistakes while setting up,
        you'll hit the rate limits of certificate providers. The Caddy
        documentation suggests the longest ban is 1 week.
      </p>

      <p>
        So for a brand new Caddyfile I tend to check that everything works over
        HTTP. When I'm confident in the basic setup, I move to HTTPS. An
        alternative approach is to use a certificate authority's
        <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#testing"
          >staging URL</a
        >
        for ACME challenges. It's worth considering for more complex sites,
        espeially if you might send or receive sensitive data during the initial
        setup.
      </p>

      <h2 id="write-a-simple-caddyfile">Write a simple Caddyfile</h2>

      <p>
        At this point Caddy is running but not actually serving anything. It's
        time to write a Caddyfile, which will tell Caddy how to serve the site.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default Caddyfile, created by Caddy on installation, is
        <code>/etc/caddy/Caddyfile</code>. Edit that file to add your own
        settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        This particular Caddyfile serves the static site via port 80 (HTTP, not
        HTTPS).
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-text">
:80 {
    root * /var/www/my-static-site
    encode gzip
    file_server {
        hide .git
    }

    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/my-static-site.log
    }

    header {
        ?Cache-Control "max-age=1800"
    }
}
</code></pre>

      <p>
        Caddy has good defaults, so there's a lot less boilerplate than I tend
        to see in Nginx configs. You might even find that some of these settings
        are irrelevant to you and can be removed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The :80 is a "block" and everything inside it is scoped to that block.
        You can have different blocks for different domains, perhaps serving
        different static sites.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case, Caddy is told to act as a file server, returning files
        from the directory <code>/var/www/my-static-site</code>. Caddy will
        return the index.html when someone goes to your root url. (The user
        doesn't have to include index.html at the end of the url.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The line inside the
        <code>file_server</code> block says that the <code>.git</code> directory
        shouldn't be served, so a user shouldn't be able to navigate to
        <code>https://example.com/.git</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        The line <code>encode gzip</code> means the files will be compressed
        using gzip and the Content-Encoding in the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Representation_header"
          >representation header</a
        >
        will say so. Compressing the response is recommended but not required.
      </p>

      <p>
        The log block specifies what should happen to access logs. (The access
        logs are different to the Caddy runtime logs, which are accessed through
        systemd, meaning
        <code>systemctl status caddy</code>.) In this case, the access logs will
        be saved to a file. Caddy creates its own log folder at
        <code>/var/log/caddy</code> and ensures the caddy user owns the
        directory, so I've found it simplest to put the access logs there. Caddy
        will use its
        <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/log#file"
          >defaults for log rotation</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        The header block specifies the Cache-Control, a.k.a. the header that
        tells browsers how long they should cache resources. Caddy usually
        passes through the Cache-Control header from the upstream server, which
        might be something like Gunicorn or uWSGI if you have a Python web
        application. But in this case there's no upstream server and no default
        Cache-Control. If you're minimising and versioning assets like CSS (e.g.
        with a hash in the file name), you might prefer to vary the
        Cache-Control so those files are cached forever. The Caddy docs have
        <a
          href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/header#examples"
          >a few examples</a
        >
        of this. Setting the Cache-Control is recommended but not essential.
      </p>

      <h2 id="use-the-new-caddyfile">Use the new Caddyfile</h2>

      <p>
        When your Caddyfile is ready, use
        <code>systemctl reload caddy</code> to tell Caddy to use the new
        version. Your static site should appear at
        <code>http://server.ip.address</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        (It's the server's IP address because no domain was specified and it's
        http:// because there's no certificate yet.)
      </p>

      <h2 id="it-isnt-working">It isn't working...</h2>

      <p>This doesn't always work. Some tips for debugging:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Check Caddy's runtime logs using <code>systemctl status caddy</code>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the summary at the top, is Caddy "active (running)"? If it
              isn't, systemd isn't running Caddy. Perhaps you restarted the
              server and didn't have Caddy set to "enabled" (auto-restarting).
              If that's the case, try <code>systemctl start caddy</code>. If
              that isn't the problem, you'll need to restart Caddy and carefully
              read the information that systemd provides (e.g. about why it
              can't run Caddy), then do some Googling.
            </li>
            <li>
              Are there any runtime logs with "level": "error"? If yes, Caddy is
              running but has some internal error. Most often I've found the
              Caddyfile is invalid. Careful reading of the error messages
              usually reveals the reason.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Can you access the static site from the server itself?
          <ul>
            <li>
              On the server, try
              <code>curl localhost</code>
              (or equivalent using something like wget). Do you get the expected
              response? If that works but you can't access the site in your
              browser, it suggests that Caddy it serving the files but they
              can't be seen outside the server. That suggests a firewall error.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you have <code>ufw</code> running? (Check using
              <code>ufw status</code>.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Does your cloud provider have a firewall whose settings must be
              changed via the web interface?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="edit-caddyfile-to-serve-via-https-on-your-domain">
        Edit Caddyfile to serve via HTTPS on your domain
      </h2>

      <p>
        If you can see your site in the browser, it's time to serve the site via
        HTTPS on your domain.
      </p>

      <p>
        In your domain name provider's web interface, you'll need to set up the
        DNS A record and possibly other records. (If you aren't sure what that
        means, don't worry. It's what tells the world that a particular domain
        points to a particular IP address. The ins and outs are beyond the scope
        of this how to, but your domain name provider probably has simple
        instructions for setting up your DNS records.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the DNS records are setup, edit the Caddyfile to use the domain
        name rather than port 80.
      </p>

      <p>The diff will look something like this:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-diff">
- :80 {
+ mydomain.com {
    root * /var/www/my-static-site
    encode gzip
    file_server {
        hide .git
    }

    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/my-static-site.log
    }

    header {
        ?Cache-Control "max-age=1800"
    }
}
</code></pre>

      <p>Only the start of the block has changed.</p>

      <p>
        In this example, the site address is <code>https://mydomain.com</code>.
        If you've decided to use the www subdomain, the diff should instead
        begin:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-diff">
- :80 {
+ www.mydomain.com {
</code></pre>

      <p>
        Tell Caddy to use the new version of the file by running
        <code>systemctl reload caddy</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wait a few moments and check the runtime logs using
        <code>systemctl status caddy</code>. Hopefully you'll see messages about
        Caddy sucessfully getting a TLS certificate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Check you can access https://mydomain.com from a web browser, replacing
        "mydomain" with your own domain.
      </p>

      <h2 id="it-isnt-working-round-2">It isn't working... (round 2)</h2>

      <p>
        Hopefully you tested everything earlier via HTTP and everything now
        works via HTTPS.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the HTTP version was fine but the HTTPS version isn't working, the
        most likely culprit is a failed ACME challenge. Check the runtime logs
        using
        <code>systemctl status caddy</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the logs confirm the challenge failed, check your DNS records and the
        server firewall. In particular, are you allowing traffic on port 443,
        the standard port for HTTPS traffic?
      </p>

      <p>
        It's also worth re-reading the first
        <a href="#it-isnt-working">It isn't working...</a> section and going
        through those debugging steps again.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are by far the most common problems that I've encountered using
        Caddy, so hopefully your static site will be up and running in no time.
      </p>

      <h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

      <p>
        The TLDR feels redundant on this one because the entire Caddyfile was
        included several times in the article. But here it is anyway.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-text">
# /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

mydomain.com {
    root * /var/www/my-static-site
    encode gzip
    file_server {
        hide .git
    }

    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/my-static-site.log
    }

    header {
        ?Cache-Control "max-age=1800"
    }
}
</code></pre>

      <p>
        Use the command <code>systemctl reload caddy</code> to tell Caddy to use
        the new version of the Caddyfile.
      </p>
