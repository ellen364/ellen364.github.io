      <h1>Faster CSV export from the Django admin</h1>

      <p>
        Adding a CSV download button to the Django admin is a common approach
        when internal users need to be able to download data. It's simple to add
        and takes advantage of existing features, like the admin itself and the
        permissions framework.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Django Admin Cookbook even provides sample code:
        <a
          href="https://books.agiliq.com/projects/django-admin-cookbook/en/latest/export.html"
          >How to export CSV from Django admin?</a
        >
        (The cookbook hasn't been updated in a while but remains a useful
        resource, especially for developers working with the admin for the first
        time.) The Cookbook code adds a new option "Export selected" to the
        "Action" dropdown on each model's list page, which is a nice use of the
        standard admin UI.
      </p>

      <p>
        The downside is that it's slow. Luckily, generating the CSV becomes much
        more efficient after minor changes to the code.

      <h2 id="a-quick-walk-through-the-original-version">
        A quick walk through the original version
      </h2>

      <p>Here's the original code.</p>

      <pre><code class="language-python">
import csv
from django.http import HttpResponse


class ExportCsvMixin:
    def export_as_csv(self, request, queryset):
        meta = self.model._meta
        field_names = [field.name for field in meta.fields]

        response = HttpResponse(content_type="text/csv")
        response["Content-Disposition"] = "attachment; filename={}.csv".format(meta)

        writer = csv.writer(response)
        writer.writerow(field_names)
        for obj in queryset:
            row = writer.writerow([getattr(obj, field) for field in field_names])

        return response

    export_as_csv.short_description = "Export Selected"
</code></pre>

      <p>
        It's a simple class, with a single method, that can be used with
        Django's standard <code>ModelAdmin</code> class. The
        <code>export_as_csv</code> method expects a <code>request</code> and a
        <code>queryset</code>, which are passed by other methods in the admin
        class. The queryset holds whatever records the user selected via the
        Django admin.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the function body, some metadata is retrieved from the model whose
        data is being downloaded. The model name becomes part of the CSV
        filename and the model field names are used to create the CSV's header
        row.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main work happens in the <code>for</code> loop, where each record in
        the queryset becomes a row in the CSV.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, the CSV response is returned, which starts the user's file
        download.
      </p>

      <h2 id="why-its-slow">Why it's slow</h2>

      <p>
        The problem with the original implementation is the
        <code>for</code> loop. The loop builds up the CSV row by row using
        <code>writerow</code>. There's also a sneaky second loop - a list
        comprehension that gets the value of each field. This happens inside the
        <code>for</code> loop, so it gets the value for each field of each
        record.
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>writerow</code> expects a "row" and the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#writer-objects"
          >Python 3 docs</a
        >
        say a row is "an iterable of strings or numbers for Writer objects". The
        queryset itself is iterable but the objects within it aren't.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's an example that tries to pass each model instance to
        <code>writerow</code>. It's a simplified version of the original code,
        without the bits specific to the Django admin. (The example uses models
        from
        <a href="https://github.com/ellen364/Django-Hospital">Django-Hospital</a
        >, which I wrote to help some junior developers learn Django queries. If
        you want to try the examples yourself, you can clone Django-Hospital.)
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-python">
import csv
from hospital.models import Doctor

with open("/home/ellen/doctors.csv", "w") as f:
    field_names = [field.name for field in Doctor._meta.fields]
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(field_names)

    for obj in Doctor.objects.all():
        writer.writerow(obj)

# Error: iterable expected, not Doctor
</code></pre>

      <p>
        As expected, the individual objects within a queryset are not iterable
        and don't count as rows. Because Django has returned a queryset of
        not-iterable model instances, the ExportCsvMixin transforms each model
        instance to a list that can be passed to <code>writerow</code>.
        Generating the CSV would be faster without that transformation step.
      </p>

      <h2 id="using-a-different-data-structure">
        Using a different data structure
      </h2>

      <p>
        Luckily, Django's queryset methods don't have to return a queryset of
        model instances, they can return other data structures.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most commonly used methods, e.g. <code>all</code> and
        <code>filter</code>, do return a queryset of ORM objects. But there are
        other methods:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>values</code> returns a queryset of dictionaries</li>
        <li><code>values_list</code> returns a queryset of tuples</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The
        <a
          href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/querysets/#values-list"
          >docs for Django 4.0</a
        >
        say "values() and values_list() are both intended as optimizations for a
        specific use case: retrieving a subset of data without the overhead of
        creating a model instance." In other words, Django does less work before
        returning the queryset.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even better, <code>values_list</code> returns a queryset of tuples,
        which is an iterable (queryset) of iterables (tuples). That meets the
        definition of a "row" expected by <code>csv.writerow</code> and the
        "iterable of rows" expected by <code>csv.writerows</code>. So the
        queryset itself can be passed to <code>csv.writerows</code>, avoiding
        the need for any transformation steps.
      </p>

      <p>The simplified version looks like this.</p>

      <pre><code class="language-python">
import csv
from hospital.models import Doctor

with open("/home/ellen/doctors.csv", "w") as f:
    field_names = [field.name for field in Doctor._meta.fields]
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(field_names)
    writer.writerows(Doctor.objects.values_list(*field_names))
</code></pre>

      <h2 id="whats-the-improvement">What's the improvement?</h2>

      <p>
        While working on this, I did some rough timings to confirm the expected
        improvement actually happened. Those timings are outlined below. The
        short version is the new code reduced the time to generate a CSV by 66%.
      </p>

      <p>
        To do the checks, I created some basic data in the form of 1,000,000
        identical doctors.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-python">
from hospital.models import Doctor

new_doctors = [
    Doctor(
        first_name="John",
        last_name="Snow",
        birth_year=1813,
        position=Doctor.ATTENDING,
        speciality=Doctor.GENERAL,
    )
    for _ in range(1000000)
]
Doctor.objects.bulk_create(new_doctors, batch_size=3000)
</code></pre>

      <p>
        Then I used the
        <a
          href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-timeit"
          >timeit "magic command"</a
        >
        in an iPython shell. Because I planned to do a few runs with
        <code>timeit</code>, I didn't want to faff around with files and used
        StringIO instead. (As a reminder, these timings weren't an exercise in
        precision, but a simple check on what I was doing.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Times were taken on a machine with 1.8GHz Intel i7-8550U (8 cores) and
        8GB RAM. Your own times will vary.
      </p>

      <h2 id="bonus-why-not-dictwriter">Bonus: Why not DictWriter?</h2>

      <p>
        Given that the Django <code>values</code> queryset method returns a
        queryset of dictionaries, you might have wondered "Why not use
        <code>csv.DictWriter</code>?"
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case, it's a less efficient option. <code>values</code>, like
        <code>values_list</code>, avoids the overhead of creating model
        instances. However, a quick look at the DictWriter code shows a problem.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-python">
# cpython/Lib/csv.py

class DictWriter:
    # some methods skipped for brevity

    def _dict_to_list(self, rowdict):
        if self.extrasaction == "raise":
            wrong_fields = rowdict.keys() - self.fieldnames
            if wrong_fields:
                raise ValueError("dict contains fields not in fieldnames: "
                                 + ", ".join([repr(x) for x in wrong_fields]))
        return (rowdict.get(key, self.restval) for key in self.fieldnames)

    def writerow(self, rowdict):
        return self.writer.writerow(self._dict_to_list(rowdict))

    def writerows(self, rowdicts):
        return self.writer.writerows(map(self._dict_to_list, rowdicts))
</code></pre>

      <p>
        The name of the <code>_dict_to_list</code> method immediately raises
        questions. Its return statement is reminiscent of the original export
        CSV code, looping over each field of each object to create an iterable.
        The <code>DictWriter.writerow</code> and
        <code>DictWriter.writerows</code> methods confirm that DictWriter uses
        <code>_dict_to_list</code> and passes the result to the standard
        <code>writer</code> implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
        So using <code>csv.DictWriter</code> adds a transformation step that
        isn't immediately obvious because it happens in the CPython code. In
        this case, it's better to fetch the data from the database as a list of
        tuples and pass it directly to <code>csv.writer</code>.
