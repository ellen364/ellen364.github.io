      <p>It's alive!</p>

      <p>
        There's power coursing through the Gigatron. The power isn't doing a lot
        right now, but it's there and it is powering a red LED.
      </p>

      <p>
        It took two goes to get the power working. I was quite pleased with the
        first attempt, but it proved a dud. Luckily the fix was absurdly simple
        - I hadn't soldered the power pins on the USB socket, so power wasn't
        even leaving the USB.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doing the power and clock has been a change from the capacitors.
        Suddenly there are different components and just finding them in the
        huge bag of bags took some time. Some of the new components require more
        care, usually because they're polarised (they have a positive and
        negative side) and have to be soldered the right way around.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along with the now-familiar capacitors, the power circuit has
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          zener diode (black cylinder with silver stripe), which I think
          protects the Gigatron if there's a power surge.
        </li>
        <li>
          multi-fuse (big orange disk), also known as a resettable fuse. Another
          component to protect against power surges. "Resettable" seems to mean
          that it can work (break the circuit) multiple times. That's excellent
          because the (normal?) fuses in my house have to be replaced if they
          blow.
        </li>
        <li>
          supervisory circuit (little black thing near LED), which somehow
          monitors the power supply and maybe does something? The articles I
          found were either vague or more technical than I understood, so this
          is pretty mysterious right now.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The last bits and pieces of the power circuit are some resistors and the
        red LED (labelled a "blinkenlight") to prove it's working.
      </p>

      <p>
        The clock circuit has even more new components, including an exciting
        first - the first integrated circuit! The IC is a 74HCT04, which its
        datasheet says is a "hex inverter". The inverter takes 6 input signals
        and for each signal produces the opposite output. That's a logical Not,
        with True becoming False and vice versa, so this is a 6 bit Not gate. I
        don't currently understand why it's in the clock.

        The other notable part of the clock is the "crystal", which looks more
        like a silver lozenge. This seems to be a "crystal oscillator", which
        has a tiny bit of quartz crystal inside the metal package. I really
        wanted to open it up and see inside, but had only bought one and had to
        put the still-whole crystal into the Gigatron instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        The crystal is designed have a particular frequency, in this case
        6.25Mhz. Remarkably, it's this oscillation that provides the clock
        signal for the Gigatron! According to Wiki, the clock signal
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_signal"
          >"oscillates between a high and a low state and is used like a
          metronome to coordinate actions of digital circuits."</a
        >
        I had no idea that's how a computer clock signal works and it was a
        delightful discovery. I was definitely one of today's
