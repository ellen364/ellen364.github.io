      <p>
        <a href="https://protohackers.com/">Protohackers</a> is a new "casual
        programming challenge in which you create servers for network protocols"
        created by (fellow Brit) James Stanley.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before starting the first challenge (0: Smoke Test) I had no clue what I
        was doing, but it sounded like fun. I figured it wouldn't be too
        difficult if I wrote the server in Python, which largely proved to be
        true. But I also hit a few walls and needed some "new to me" debugging
        techniques.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that in mind, I decided to do a small write up for people who are
        feeling overwhelmed or stuck. I'll avoid substantial spoilers or code,
        but will talk a little about problems I encountered.
      </p>

      <h2 id="using-python">Using Python</h2>

      <p>
        Python has (at least) 3 modules for working with sockets. There's the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html">socket</a>
        module,
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html"
          >socketserver</a
        >
        and chunks of
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html"
          >asyncio</a
        >. That means there's a lot of documentation and it can be tricky to
        look things up because people do things in lots of different ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        asyncio is all about concurrency, which is good for web servers. But
        asyncio streams introduce a lot of abstraction and new concepts, meaning
        they're less useful if you want to learn about networking.
      </p>

      <p>
        socketserver "simplifies the task of writing network servers", to quote
        the docs. Useful in production code but, again, less useful if you want
        to learn about networking.
      </p>

      <p>
        socket is what serversocket is built on. It's much closer to the C and
        Linux socket APIs and means you have to do more work to get a working
        server. But this is Python, so "more work" means creating a basic server
        takes 10-15 lines of code.
      </p>

      <h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

      <p>
        Your server has to be publicly accessible so the Protohackers testing
        system can send requests and see if the server passes the tests.
      </p>

      <p>
        I ran my server as a normal Python script, e.g.
        <code>python 0_smoke_test.py</code> and stopped the program when the
        tests were finished. It doesn't need a fancy setup.
      </p>

      <p>For some people, the sticking point will be the hosting itself.</p>

      <p>
        You can host your server at home. My knowledge of networking is almost
        0, so I didn't feel like opening a port on my home router!
      </p>

      <p>
        For cloud hosting, the cheapest option is probably Google Cloud
        Platform, which provides an "always free" e2-micro virtual machine.
        Smaller companies like Hetzner charge pennies per hour.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you've never run a virtual machine in the cloud before, Protohackers
        is a good way to start. You don't have to get a complex production
        environment running; all you need is an operating system and appropriate
        version of Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cloud providers generally have standard "images" of operating systems
        like Ubuntu and Fedora and let you pick which OS runs on your virtual
        machine. Even better, recent versions of Ubuntu, Fedora and so on
        usually have recent versions of Python.
      </p>

      <h3 id="firewalls">Firewalls</h3>

      <p>
        Making your server accessible from the outside world usually means
        configuring a firewall.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was using
        <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall">ufw</a> as a
        firewall and added a rule to unblock the port where the "smoke test"
        server was running. Bizarrely, Protohackers still couldn't access it.
        I'd forgotten that Hetzner has a separate firewall controlled through
        the account page, so connections were still being refused on the port.
      </p>

      <h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

      <p>
        At a few points I had no idea how to start debugging a test failure. The
        Protohackers tests provide little information about what went wrong and
        it became obvious that I needed a lot more insight into what was
        happening.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's crucial to be able to send your own requests to your server and see
        how it responds. I mostly used
        <a
          href="https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/telnet-invocation.html"
          >telnet</a
        >
        to send requests. If you aren't familiar with something like telnet, you
        might find it easier to write a little Python client to send requests.
      </p>

      <p>
        To see what messages are getting passed around, the Protohackers "help"
        page recommended <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</a>. Julia
        Evans's free
        <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/tcpdump/"
          >Let's learn tcpdump!</a
        >
        zine turned out to be exactly what I needed. It explains the basics of
        the tcpdump output and common flags. I found I just wanted to "listen on
        all interfaces, listen to a specific port" and to control whether
        tcpdump printed packet contents or not. (Seeing the packet content is
        sometimes useful, sometimes overwhelming.)
      </p>

      <p>
        It's also useful to have logging (or prints) in the server itself. One
        "Aha!" moment came when I realised that a particular request appeared in
        the tcpdump output but not the server logs.
      </p>

      <h2 id="bits-and-pieces">Bits and pieces</h2>

      <p>
        Don't worry too much about async or multi-threaded code. You can
        definitely complete 0: Smoke Test with ordinary, synchronous code. (I
        know because that's how I wrote my first version.) For 1: Prime Time you
        might find that a single process struggles to handle the multi-client
        tests, but you can always switch to a concurrent implementation after
        the core code is written.
      </p>

      <p>
        TCP is a "streaming protocol". This becomes more relevant in 1: Prime
        Time, where the specification says that each request and each response
        is "a single line containing a JSON object, terminated by a newline
        character ('\n', or ASCII 10)". But TCP doesn't guarantee that you'll
        receive exactly one of those JSON messages at a time. You might only
        receive a few bytes (just part of the message) or, because the client
        can reuse the connection, you might receive several messages at once.
        It's something that your server needs to be able to handle.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're undecided about trying Protohackers: practically everything in
        this post is something I learned while doing Protohackers challenges 0
        Smoke Test and 1 Prime Time. (Admittedly I already knew most of the
        content in the Hosting section.) Protohackers was a really fun way to
        start learning about networking. Perhaps you'll enjoy it too.

          (specifically the Bandit game) is a fun way to learn Linux commands
          like ssh and telnet. Other games are about cybersecurity. Here in the
          UK your ISP might block it as a "hacking website", in which case
          you'll need to fiddle with the parental controls that some ISPs turn
          on by default.
