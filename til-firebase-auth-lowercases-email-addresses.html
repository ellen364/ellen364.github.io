        TIL: Firebase Auth lowercases email addresses, despite SMTP
      </h1>

      <p>
        Firebase Auth stores user email addreses in lowercase, regardless of the
        case passed to Firebase. That can be surprising when comparing email
        addreseses. It's even more surprising given the risk of sending password
        reset emails to the wrong person.
      </p>

      <p>
        The section of an email address before the <code>@</code> symbol is the
        "local-part". It's the name of a mailbox in the receiving mail system.
        Mailbox names are often the same as the username of the user to which
        the mailbox belongs (<code>username@domain.tld</code>) but they don't
        have to be. In organisations, role-based local-parts are also common
        (<code>jobs@domain.tld</code>) and some email providers let users choose
        any mailbox name that hasn't already been taken.
      </p>

      <p>
        SMTP specifies that the local-part of an email address is case
        sensitive. This means that <code>SomeMailbox</code> does not necessarily
        equal <code>somemailbox</code>. Each can be a separate mailbox and might
        belong to different people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given that SMTP specifies local-part case sensitivity, it might be
        surprising that I said "<code>SomeMailbox</code>
        <em>does not necessarily</em> equal <code>somemailbox</code>", implying
        that the two might be equivalent. Many email providers do not use case
        sensitive local-parts. And, somewhat confusingly, RFCs like RFC 5321
        actually discourage mail systems from enforcing case sensitivity:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The local-part of a mailbox MUST BE treated as case sensitive.
          Therefore, SMTP implementations MUST take care to preserve the case of
          mailbox local-parts. In particular, for some hosts, the user "smith"
          is different from the user "Smith". However, exploiting the case
          sensitivity of mailbox local-parts impedes interoperability and is
          discouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321#section-2.4"
            >RFC 5321 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, section 2.4</a
          >
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I get the impression that SMTP was created with the case sensitive
        local-part, it began to seem like a bad idea (e.g. lots of users typing
        <code>johnsmith</code> when they meant <code>JohnSmith</code>),
        enforcement is now discouraged but the issue never actually dealt with.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going back to the start, Firebase Auth converts user email addresses to
        lowercase, forcing an assumption that case doesn't matter in email
        addresses. That assumption is incorrect. Where a mail system does use
        and enforce case sensitive mailbox names, important emails like password
        resets will be addressed to the wrong mailbox. The person who controls
        the lowercase mailbox name ultimately controls whatever account is
        behind Firebase Auth.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've discussed this with about half a dozen people and, so far, everyone
        has assumed that only a tiny number of people could be affected. That
        was my first thought, too, but then I realised the information available
        is asymmetric. Large, public email providers like Gmail don't use case
        sensitive local-parts in their email addresses, so there are lots of
        free email addresses where this doesn't matter. But what about the many
        mail systems run by organisations - big companies, universities,
        government departments? So far, I haven't found any survey of how many
        mail systems are case sensitive, so it's difficult to know how many
        people and accounts might be affected. But it's probably more than 0.
      </p>

      <p>
        If anyone has a survey that covers enforcement of case sensitive
        local-parts by mail systems, I'd be interested to read it. Let me know
        at <a href="mailto:blog@ellen.dev">blog@ellen.dev</a>

          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc821">RFC 821</a> is
          the earliest RFC for SMTP. Section 2 and the scenarios in Appendix F
          have language suggesting that mailbox names matched their user's name,
          with a simple 1 mailbox to 1 user relationship. 40 years later, things
          like email aliases and shared mailboxes (e.g. for customer service)
          have complicated that relationship.
