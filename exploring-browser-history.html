        Recently I've been trying different search engines like
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> and
        <a href="https://kagi.com">Kagi</a>. I started wondering how how often
        I'm falling back to Google. Am I habitually using Google search? Or
        perhaps not finding what I want via other search engines?
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than looking in the History tab, I decided to grab the data
        myself. Perhaps I'd visualise the data or do something interesting with
        it. (Spoiler: I didn't. But I did play around with proc and Python's
        sqlite3, the subjects of this post.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Fair warning: this post isn't a "how to". I like reading about how
        someone worked something out and this post is in that style. Essentially
        it's "How I learned a little about how my browser stores data".
      </p>

      <h2 id="finding-the-browser-history">Finding the browser history</h2>
      <p>
        I don't usually pay attention to my browser history and had no idea
        where it's stored. Luckily, Mozilla explains
        <a
          href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data"
          >where Firefox stores all sorts of data</a
        >, from bookmarks and history to your personal dictionary and toolbar
        customisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Ubuntu, the Firefox history is stored in
        <code>~/.mozilla/firefox/$your_profile_directory/places.sqlite</code>
        where <code>$your_profile_directory</code> has a value specific to you,
        but probably includes the word "default".

        Next challenge: how do I query a SQLite database using Python?
      </p>
      <p>
        I was surprised to realise that I didn't know this. (If I'm working with
        a database in Python, usually I'm using Django.) I had vague memories of
        using a sqlite package, though not the last time I used it. Turns out
        it's the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html"
          >sqlite3 module</a
        >
        in Python's standard library.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official docs are mostly a description of the API but also contain
        useful advice. At the end is
        <a
          href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#using-sqlite3-efficiently"
          >"Using sqlite3 efficiently"</a
        >. I didn't read that right away, so I spent a while manually fiddling
        with <code>Cursor</code> objects instead of letting sqlite3 do it for
        me. The section has other useful tips and is well worth reading.
      </p>
      <p>Anyway, time for a bit of database exploration.</p>

      <pre><code class="language-python">
import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path

# In my case, the path was approximately
FIREFOX_PATH = Path.home() / ".mozilla/firefox/fi3dmgd.default-release/places.sqlite"
db = sqlite3.connect(FIREFOX_PATH)

# What tables do I have?
db.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';").fetchall()

# Lots of tables... moz_historyvisits looks promising. What's in it?
db.execute("SELECT * FROM moz_historyvisits").fetchmany(3)

# Hmm. That only shows data (row content). What are the columns?
db.execute("SELECT name from PRAGMA_TABLE_INFO('moz_historyvisits');").fetchall()

# No URL, but there is a place_id. Presumably a foreign key to the places table. What's in that?
db.execute("SELECT name from PRAGMA_TABLE_INFO('moz_places');").fetchall()

# Found the URL. (Plus some surpising things like rev_host, the host name stored reversed.)
# So I need something like this:
db.execute(
    """
    SELECT visit_date, url FROM moz_historyvisits
    LEFT JOIN moz_places on moz_historyvisits.place_id = moz_places.id
    WHERE moz_places.url LIKE 'https://kagi.com%' OR moz_places.url LIKE 'https://duckduckgo.com%' OR moz_places.url LIKE 'https://www.google.co%/search?%'
    """
)

db.close()
</code></pre>
      <p>
        It took a while to work out how to list tables or columns. A lot of
        information about SQLite assumes the reader is using SQLite's CLI, but
        convenience commands like
        <code>.tables</code>
        don't exist in the Python sqlite3 module. SQLite does, however, have
        <a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html">PRAGMA statements</a>, an
        extension to normal SQL. They mostly seem to let you query database
        metadata.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also tweaked the Google match string a couple of times. Initially it
        was too broad, matching pages from Google Maps and other bits of the
        Google ecosystem. In a different way, the first version was too narrow
        because I wanted results for google.com and google.co.uk.
      </p>
      <p>
        More importantly: this code isn't production-ready. It doesn't handle
        errors and because I was doing simple, one-off SELECTs, I didn't care
        about things like transactions or rollback behaviour.
      </p>

        Finding the browser history, proc edition
      </h2>
      <p>
        That was Firefox done, but I've also been trying the Vivaldi browser.
        Rather than look up where Vivaldi stores its data, I decided to work
        this one out myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking through options, <code>find</code> didn't seem promising
        because I didn't know what the file would be called or whether it would
        definitely be another SQLite database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another option was <code>strace</code>, which seems incredibly useful
        <a href="https://jvns.ca/categories/strace/"
          >whenever Julia Evans writes about it</a
        >. Connecting to the Vivaldi process with <code>strace</code> proved
        pretty overwhelming and I still wasn't sure what I was looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I figured that Vivaldi probably accesses the history a lot. And it
        probably needs other config and data files, which are likely to be in a
        directory near wherever the history is stored. All of which meant I
        could probably find the history by looking at the files Vivalidi had
        open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter <code>/proc</code>, which exposes a great deal of information
        about the OS, including information about running processes. I knew that
        <code>/proc/some_pid/fd</code> would show me the files (fd = file
        descriptors) the process has open. So first I needed to find the Vivaldi
        process ID (pid).
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">

        </code></pre>
      <p>
        There were a lot more Vivaldi processes than I expected. But now I knew
        the process was called vivaldi-bin and the parent (main) process had pid
        27852. (The number next to 27852 is the pid of its own parent, in this
        case 1, aka systemd, which starts programs.)
      </p>
      <p>
        (If you're wondering how I know this, it's from using commands like
        <code>pstree -ps some_pid</code>, which shows the full tree of processes
        for the specified pid, including systemd which is the root of the tree.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If I'd been more observant at that point, I could have answered my
        question "Where's the browser data?" One of the Vivaldi processes runs
        with the option
        <code>--database=~/.config/vivaldi/Crash Reports</code> and it seems
        reasonable to guess the history database is stored somewhere near the
        Crash Reports. But I didn't notice that at the time.
      </p>
      <p>Instead, I took the longer route and used /proc</p>

      <pre><code class="language-bash">
$ ls -l /proc/27852/fd

# Most output skipped for brevity
total 0
lr-x------ 1 ellen ellen 64 May 25 14:26 0 -> /dev/null

lrwx------ 1 ellen ellen 64 May 25 14:26 47 -> /home/ellen/.config/vivaldi/Default/History
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Using the <code>file</code> command confirmed that "History" was an
        SQLite database, so I figured that was probably the file I wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post is already long, so I won't show code snippets exploring this
        database. The short version: there's a table called "visits", which has
        the visit time and a foreign key to a table called "urls". The "urls"
        table contains the URL itself and the page title.
      </p>

        Finding the browser history, lsof edition
      </h2>
      <p>
        Shortly after I'd found the file using /proc, I realised that I could
        have achieved the same thing using the command <code>lsof</code> (ls
        open files), which would have looked something like this.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">
$ ps -ef | grep vivaldi
ellen   27852   1  1 08:37 ?   00:00:11 /opt/vivaldi/vivaldi-bin --enable-crashpad

# As ever, lots of output skipped for brevity
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The <code>-p</code> flag shows all the open files for the specified pid.
        That includes a lot of things like sockets, which I didn't care about.
        The REG type are "regular files", so I grepped that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't used <code>lsof</code> much, but I suspect it's usually a
        better option than directly accessing /proc. Whoever wrote
        <code>lsof</code> probably knew a lot more about the Linux file system
        than I do and knew more of the edge cases. But it's handy to know what
        data <code>lsof</code> is accessing.
      </p>

      <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
      <p>
        As for my search engine experiment, the results aren't interesting yet.
        Since signing up for the Kagi beta, it seems to be my default search
        engine. It's possible that's because it's the newest and shiniest search
        engine. But it also suggests that I haven't had much reason to fall back
        to Google.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I could have more easily learned that from the History panels
        of the various browsers. But it's fun to see how things work behind the
        UI and I got to play a little with the sqlite3 module.
