        TIL: Keyboard navigation should tab between components, but not within
        them
      </h1>

      <p>
        It's fashionable for input boxes to contain a clickable element, e.g. a
        search icon or a button to clear the input. I've worked on a couple of
        projects where it was expected that those elements were part of the tab
        sequence when using a keyboard to navigate the page. E.g. a tab takes
        you into the input box, where you can type, then onto the search icon
        thats nested inside the box, then out of the input box and onto the next
        element.
      </p>

      <p>
        Turns out that's wrong. ARIA says that only 1 part of a "composite UI
        component" should receive tab focus:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          As described in section Fundamental Keyboard Navigation Conventions,
          the tab sequence should include only one focusable element of a
          composite UI component. Once a composite contains focus, keys other
          than Tab and Shift + Tab enable the user to move focus among its
          focusable elements.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <span>- </span>

          Components</a
        >
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        So the other elements (e.g. the search button nested inside a search
        box) should be navigable via keyboard, but using other keys.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that I've read the guide, the behaviour makes a lot of sense. And it
        seems standard in more traditional elements -- if you open a dropdown
        select element, the items are navigated using the up and down arrow
        keys, not the tab key. A group of radio buttons works similarly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also learned that the awkwardly named ARIA Authoring Practices Guide has a great
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/">Patterns</a> section
        summarising the recommended keyboard behaviour and attributes for
        different elements (alerts, comboboxs, tab groups and so on). It focuses
        on the implementation details needed by devs and has gone into my bookmarks.
