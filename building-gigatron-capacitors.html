        Enough parts have arrived to start building the Gigatron. The assembly
        guide suggests the build takes 3 or 4 hours. Given my lack of
        experience, I suspect it will take longer. (Possibly much longer.) The
        plan is to space out the build, doing 1 or 2 steps at a time. That will
        allow some time for reading at each step, learning a little about what
        I've just added to the Gigatron.

      <p>Onto step 1.</p>

      <blockquote cite="https://gigatron.io/media/Gigatron-manual.pdf">
        <p>
          To practice with soldering, we start by soldering 40 ceramic 100nF
          capacitors, marked C5 through C44.
        </p>

      <p>
        40 ceramic capacitors, each with 2 pins, sounded like a lot of soldering
        but I definitely needed the practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the PCB the capacitors are arranged in a roughly clockwise pattern,
        which is a tiny but lovely detail. The arrangement makes it easier to
        move from C5 to C6, for example, and be confident that none of the
        locations have been missed. Marcel van Kervinck and Walter Belgers
        clearly put a lot of care and thought into creating the Gigatron.

        Soldering felt very slow at first. I was out of practice - and didn't
        have much in the first place - so everything felt unfamiliar. After a
        while it became oddly meditative. Half listening to something on the
        radio while soldering felt much more relaxing than half listening to
        music while coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not having a good inside location for soldering, I've been doing it
        outside. There's an exterior power plug, so it's convenient, and the
        ventilation is good. The downside is the weather. After soldering about
        20 capacitors, it started raining. Quickly grabbing things while getting
        rained on and trying to avoid a hot soldering iron wasn't fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        After everything dried a bit, soldering resumed and I managed to finish
        the 40 capacitors. Some fiddling with the multimeter ensued as I worked
        out how to test for the "infinte resistance" the guide says the circuit
        should have at this point. It seems good and the soldering looks much
        better than my previous attempts, so hopefully it all works.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before starting to solder, I'd wondered why on earth I was soldering 40
        capacitors. Capacitors store energy and seem to be used in circuits for
        a bunch of different reasons. In the Gigatron, the capacitors are
        probably there to smooth out the power supply. If the voltage of the
        power supply drops briefly, capacitors can make up the difference and
        maintain the correct voltage. It sounds like integrated circuits (ICs),
        the little black chips that will go into the Gigatron, are sensitive to
        small changes in voltage, so the capacitors help protect the chips.
        Those 80 points of soldering to add the capacitors suddenly seem a lot
        more worthwhile.
