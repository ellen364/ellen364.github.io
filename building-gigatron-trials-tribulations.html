        Building a Gigatron: Trials and Tribulations
      </h1>

      <p>
        Progress has been slow recently. The weather was erratic, alternately
        rainy and windy, so I couldn't solder outside. As the weather settled
        down, I managed to destroy my soldering iron tip.

      <p>
        Needless to say, I hadn't been taking care of the tip properly. I wasn't
        tinning it nearly enough and oxidisation built up. Not understanding
        what was going on, it seemed like the soldering iron wasn't working
        properly, so I turned up the temperature and made the oxidisation even
        worse. Trying to salvage the severely oxidised tip, I used some tip
        tinner. But the oxidisation was severe and the cleaning paste corrosive,
        so the tip pretty much dissolved.
      </p>

      <p>
        The soldering iron came with another tip but it's wider. Although I
        managed to do a bit of soldering with it, the resulting joints were
        pretty bad. It was difficult to get the larger tip onto the pad without
        damaging the PCB. Being cautious meant the pad didn't heat enough and I
        had joints that only partially covered the metal ring. (Credit to the
        <a
          href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/common-problems"
          >Adafruit Guide to Excellent Soldering</a
        >
        which helped me understand what was going on. They describe this problem
        as "insufficient wetting of the pad").
      </p>

      <p>
        More soldering iron tips have arrived, along with some brass wool to
        help keep the new tips clean, so soldering can resume.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's the current state of the Gigatron. I'm still a very slow solderer
        and the ICs have an incredible number of pins, but hopefully I'll get it
        done before the weather turns colder.
