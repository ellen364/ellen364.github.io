      <p>
        PyCon UK 2022 was held in Cardiff City Hall after a 3 year break due to
        covid. It was my first time attending PyCon UK or any Python conference.
        I'm told there were fewer talks than usual, but I still didn't see
        anywhere near all of them!
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are a few that I particularly enjoyed, in the order they were
        given.
      </p>

      <h2 id="its-your-callable-a-tour-of-pythons-callable-function-interface">
        It's your callable: a tour of Python's callable function interface

        Talk by Dom Weldon.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a63rn66Hu74"
          >Video on YouTube</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dom gave an enjoyable summary of callable behaviour, with a focus on
        reading and modifying a callable's metadata.
      </p>

      <p>
        Covers some subtleties of Python scope, e.g. when to use the
        <code>nonlocal</code> keyword, which will be useful to people coming to
        Python from other languages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lightning talk by Steve Dower.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/bDo0FKmosnA?t=1718">Video on YouTube</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Steve explained the recently patched CVE-2020-10735, which affected code
        like <code>int(user_input)</code>. It's worth noting that since the
        patch, <code>int</code> throws a ValueError when the input is too big.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the first short / lightning talk I've seen about a CVE. It's a
        great idea, and a short talk seem like a good format for it. Hopefully
        others will follow suit.
      </p>

        How to walk in a straight line

      <p>
        Lightning talk by Alastair Stanley.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/FFZHt_BPXXE?t=591">Video on YouTube</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My summary doesn't do the talk justice, but here it is: Alastair arrived
        in Cardiff early, used OpenStreetMap data to calculate the straightest
        walkable line across the city and then tried to walk it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was a really fun talk, not least because I had no idea there's a
        community of people who try to walk across cities and even countries (!)
        in the straightest line possible.
      </p>

        Talk by Peter Russell.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gIX_-ABHs8"
          >Video on YouTube</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        A talk about the <a href="https://gigatron.io/">Gigatron</a>, "a TTL
        microcomputer that you build yourself". Most of this talk went over my
        head, but it left an impression. I impulse bought a Gigatron printed
        circuit board (PCB) at the end of the talk and since then have been
        buying the components.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peter also showed off the Gigatron at the Python on Hardware Community
        Showcase session. Sadly I didn't get a chance to chat to him. If anyone
        reading this knows Peter, please let him know that he's inspired at
        least one more Gigatron build!
      </p>

        Pointers? In my Python? It's more likely than you think
      </h2>

      <p>
        Talk by Eli Holderness.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITr3O3sqhVg"
          >Video on YouTube</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        The start of the talk is a really clear explanation of why changing one
        list can modify another list and why tuples are sometimes unexpectedly
        mutable. It's become my go-to recommendation for anyone having trouble
        with copy behaviour in Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second part of the talk digs deeper, into the details of reference
        counting, cyclic references and garbage collection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eli mentioned they're preparing a talk on scope, which I look forward to
        seeing.

        Lightning talk by Adam Johnson.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/NbkD0hNyetg?t=398">Video on YouTube</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Practically anything I say about this talk will spoil it, so I'll just
        say it's technology related and well worth 5 minutes of your time.
      </p>

      <h2 id="useful-things">Useful things</h2>

      <p>
        These were a few of my favourite talks, but PyCon UK had many other
        talks and they're worth a watch. The lightning talks were especially
        varied, with something for practically everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        The conference organisers have helpfully grouped the days into
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PyconUKSoc/playlists"
          >YouTube playlists</a
        >, so it's easy to look at the
        <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/schedule/"
          >conference schedule</a
        >
        and find a video.
